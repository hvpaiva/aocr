# ðŸŽ„ Advent of Code - Rust Solutions ðŸ¦€

Welcome to the **Advent of Code** (AOC) repository! Here, youâ€™ll find my solutions to the AOC challenges, all implemented in **Rust**. This repository isnâ€™t meant to be a template, but feel free to use it as inspiration for your own solutions.

> ðŸŒŸ The Advent of Code is a beloved holiday tradition for programmers and enthusiasts, running each December with 25 daily coding challenges inspired by the Christmas spirit! ðŸŒŸ
